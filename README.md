SE101 Group Project

SE101 is a concepts course taken by first year software engineers. A large portion of the course was a group project,
where groups of 5 members were asked to come up with a creative way to program a hardware board. The board had a temperature
sensor, an accelerometer, two buttons, a potentiometer and a 128x32 pixel led display. Our group chose to program the display
into a sidescrolling game, using the buttons as jump controls and the potentiometer as a speed control. This is seemingly 
an easy task, but we were using a new language on a new platform and without many of the tools that we were used to in other
programming environments. SE101.ino cannot be run on a computer, but the code is available to observe any design strategies
or techniques we used in programming this game.
